# The Flying Project
As part of the Information Processing module, we designed and implemented a functional 2 Player Flight Simulator Game. Players use a custom controller implemented using the DE10-Lite FPGA Board as a joystick to control the plane's movement, playing in the same world but with a fully wireless controller and separate output screens.
